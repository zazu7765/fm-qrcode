## Overview
I didn't really want to work with the specific colour codes so I just stayed somewhat accurate on the background and winged the rest of the colours.

## My process

### Built with
- Mobile-First design
- TailwindCSS


### What I learned
I learned more about how I can use Tailwind's utility classes to rapidly iterate over designs (and botched CSS) without the headache of trying to figure out which class is actually messing with my content.

### Continued development
I plan to keep using Tailwind for small projects due to how convenient it is to both integrate into a project and to use thanks to the detailed documentation.
### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - An excellent resource for anybody using Tailwind as actually reading the documentation helps you transfer between regular CSS to utility classes
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - My go-to before I even start styling anything
